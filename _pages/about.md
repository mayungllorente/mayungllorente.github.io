I am a research analyst at the research department (DIE) of the Central Bank of Chile. My research interests lie in understanding the role of microeconomic heterogeneity in macroeconomic outcomes. My research experience is related to firm dynamics, production networks, labor market dynamics, and pricing.

I got my MSc. in Economics from the University of Chile. I am currently applying for a PhD in Economics.

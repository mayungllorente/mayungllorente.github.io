Welcome to my website (still under construction). 

I am research analyst at the research department (DIE) of the Central Bank of Chile. My research experience is related to topics such as production networks, labor market dynamics and pricing. 

I got my MSc. in Economics from the University of Chile. Hopefully, this year I will apply for PhD in Economics (2023).

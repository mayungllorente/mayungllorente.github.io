Welcome to my website (still under construction). 

I am research analyst at the research department (DIE) of the Central Bank of Chile. I obtain my MSc. in Economics from the University of Chile. My research interests include: A, B and C.

Hopefully, this year I will apply for PhD in Economics. (2023).

Welcome to my website (still under construction). 

I am a research analyst at the research department (DIE) of the Central Bank of Chile. My research experience is related to firm dynamics, production networks, labor market dynamics, and pricing. However, my academic interests go beyond these topics.

I got my MSc. in Economics from the University of Chile. Hopefully, this year I will apply for PhD in Economics (2023).

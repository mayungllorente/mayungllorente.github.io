I am a research analyst at the research department (DIE) of the Central Bank of Chile. My research interests lie in understanding the role of microeconomic heterogeneity in macroeconomic outcomes. My research experience is related to firm dynamics, production networks, labor market dynamics, and pricing.

I got my M.A. in Economics from the University of Chile. Currently, I'm applying to doctoral programs in economics.

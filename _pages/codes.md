I am currently preparing replicable code to share with you.

> Dealing with matrices in Stata

> Using Python from Stata

> Approximation of the inverse of huge matrices

> Short introduction to frames in Stata

> Colorpalettes

In the meantime, here are some pages that may be useful to you:

* [<b>The Stata Guide</b>](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide): you will find many advanced Stata tips. Learn about visualization, framing, and more here.

* [<b>R graph gallery</b>](https://r-graph-gallery.com/all-graphs.html): do you need inspiration to make figures? this is the right place to get it.

* [<b>Stata-to-Python equivalences</b>](https://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_stata_to_python.html#bysort): Switching from Stata to Python? Here you will find the basics to maintain your workflow.
